### **Ten Business Lessons from Mad Men's Don Draper**

### 1\. Break the mold

"If you don't like what is being said, then change the conversation." -- Don Draper

### 2\. Play on emotion

"Advertising is based on one thing -- happiness." -- Don Draper

### 3\. Focus on customer retention, more than lead generation

"What's happiness? It's a moment before you need more happiness." -- Don Draper

### 4\. Fail fast and move on

"I have a life and it only goes in one direction -- forward." -- Don Draper

### 5\. Not everything is as it seems

"The reason you haven't felt it is because it doesn't exist. What you call 'love' was invented by guys like me -- to sell Nylons." -- Don Draper

### 6\. Don't twist the truth

"It wasn't a lie, it was ineptitude with insufficient cover." -- Don Draper

### 7\. Bring a constant stream of ideas

"I'm sure you do (have ideas). Sterling Cooper has more failed artists and intellectuals than the Third Reich." - Don Draper

### 8\. Roll with the constant pace of digital change

"Change is neither good nor bad. It simply is." -- Don Draper

### 9\. Be brave -- fail often

"I'm glad this is an environment where you feel free to fail." -- Don Draper

### 10\. Look at it another way

"Everyone else's tobacco is poisonous. Lucky Strike's is toasted."

Andiamo!
